## Lessons Learned
This was my very first React project that I chose to build using Vite + React. I learned how to create separate components, how to import images and  FontAwesome icons into React. 

I updated the app, adding a feature to toggle between light and dark mode using React State Hook. I added an event listener on the toggle button to determine whether state isDarkMode was true or false. I then applied that logic to determine whether it will add the class name "light" to my existing elements, and added the CSS styling accordingly. This was a very fun functionality to work on, and has inspired me to incorporate it into my other projects.
